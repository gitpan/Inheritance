Once you have downloaded Inheritance-0.XX.tar.gz and have extracted it
into a convienient directory, make sure you have entered the Inheritance
directory created before proceeding.

Run the command 'perl Makefile.PL ; make test' from your shell prompt.
If all goes well, all tests should succeed and you can continue on to
'make install'.

To make sure it was installed correctly, run 'perl test.pl'. If all
tests succeed, you will be the proud owner of a system that has
Inheritance!

If any test other than the first fails, there is a bug in the program.
I would be grateful if you could sent a bug-report to jql@accessone.com.

If the first test fails, you probably aren't root.
